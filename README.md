# Concrete_strength
# Project Overview
This project explores the use of Machine Learning to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mixture components. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information about various materials used in cement manufacturing and their impact on concrete properties. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the compressive strength of concrete.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains 1030 observations with the following features:

Cement: Amount of cement in the mix (kg per cubic meter).
Blast Furnace Slag: Byproduct of steel manufacturing with cementitious properties (kg per cubic meter).
Fly Ash: Byproduct of coal combustion, used as a supplementary material (kg per cubic meter).
Water: Quantity of water used in the mix (kg per cubic meter).
Superplasticizer: Chemical additive used to enhance concrete properties (kg per cubic meter).
Coarse Aggregate: Coarse particles used in the mix (kg per cubic meter).
Fine Aggregate: Fine particles used in the mix (kg per cubic meter).
Age: Age of the concrete in days.
Strength: Compressive strength of the concrete (MPa).
Problem Definition
The task is a supervised regression problem where the objective is to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mixture components.

# Data Cleaning and Exploration
The initial dataset contained 1030 observations and 9 columns.
Duplicate rows were identified and removed, resulting in 1005 unique observations.
No missing values were present in the dataset.
Features were renamed for clarity.
Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Statistical Analysis and Model Building
Multiple regression models were built and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.

# Models included:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
XGBoost Regression

# Results
XGBoost Regression was identified as the best model based on performance metrics, including R-squared (0.92) and Mean Squared Error (23.80).
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the XGBoost model.

# Model Evaluation
The best XGBoost model was evaluated using various metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 23.80
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.96
R-squared (R2) Score: 0.90
Explained Variance Score: 0.90

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of Machine Learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The XGBoost model, with optimized hyperparameters, provided the best performance.
